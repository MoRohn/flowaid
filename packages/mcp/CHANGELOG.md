### Minor Changes

- dff6c83: FlowAId behaves like a desktop application on macOS and Windows alike.

  - `./flowaid` (`flowaid.cmd` on Windows) opens FlowAId in its own app window (Chrome, Edge, Brave
    or Chromium; otherwise the default browser), with its icon in the menu bar or the notification
    area: Open FlowAId, Quit FlowAId, and what runs in the background (runs in progress, approvals
    waiting; a notification when an approval arrives, a badge on macOS). Quitting from the icon
    while runs are in progress asks first.
  - In the app, the power button and the command menu offer **Close window** (FlowAId keeps
    running; the icon reopens it) and **Quit FlowAId** (after a confirmation that says what is
    running). New `/v1/desktop` routes (session-only, `admin`, audited), `features.desktop`, and
    `FLOWAID_LAUNCHER_URL`/`FLOWAID_LAUNCHER_TOKEN`.
  - Nothing is left running: every process runs under a guard that stops its whole tree with the
    launcher, however the launcher stops (Quit, Ctrl+C, a closed terminal, a crash). A second
    `./flowaid` opens the running instance's window, and a start after a hard crash ends what was
    left. On Windows the API and worker stop gracefully over IPC. `pnpm smoke:desktop` checks all
    of it, and CI runs it on Windows and macOS.
  - Windows fixes: artifact storage paths, stdio MCP servers (Windows executable paths accepted,
    shells and scripts refused, process trees ended with `taskkill`), and PageIndex finds Python
    through the `py` launcher.
