### Minor Changes

- 614fb1a: FlowAId V2: what needs you, what changed, and why. The Overview opens with "Needs attention"
  (open approvals, workflows with failed runs) and "What changed" (statistically tested regressions
  per workflow in failure rate, latency, cost and decision confidence, and new error codes, with
  their evidence and the version they coincide with; `GET /v1/insights`). Ask FlowAId answers
  questions about the workspace from read-only lookups, typing each statement as a fact,
  calculation, suggestion or unconfirmed and linking the records it cites
  (`POST /v1/assistant/ask`, `pnpm eval:assistant`). Streamed generations are priced, metrics count
  production traffic by default, the retention sweep runs, runs no longer hang in Redis mode, and
  local mode stays on loopback.
