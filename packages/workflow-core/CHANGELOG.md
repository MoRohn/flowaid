- 0778a7b: MCP tools that survive deploys, and stdio MCP servers you can test and discover.

  A workflow exposed as an MCP tool under Triggers, MCP tools now stays exposed when you deploy,
  redeploy or roll back the workflow. It keeps its tool name and description, and clients see it
  whenever a version is deployed to its environment. Each tool in the list has an On/Off switch,
  so a switched-off tool can be switched back on; deploys leave the switch as you set it. A tool
  made before anything is deployed says it is waiting for a deployment. A tool declared by a
  version's own MCP trigger works as before: a later version without the trigger switches it off,
  and switching it back on makes it yours. Tools that a deploy switched off before this release are
  switched back on (migration 0015). `PATCH /v1/mcp/exposures/:id` takes `enabled` and
  `description`, and the exposure list reports `source`, `deployed` and `active`.

  stdio MCP servers can now be tested and discovered. The api never starts a program itself: it
  hands the test or discovery to the worker, which checks the command against its allow-list again,
  starts it, and stores the tools it lists on the server, so they reach agents and the MCP tool
  step. Each start is recorded in the audit log by name only. If no worker answers within 45
  seconds, the test says so.

  The Connect MCP server dialog can test the settings before saving them
  (`POST /v1/mcp/servers/test`, for HTTP and stdio servers); nothing is stored by the test.

- 6b5c535: A key set in the server's environment (TYPESAFE_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
  OLLAMA_HOST) now answers a workflow's required secret of that type when nothing is bound in the
  environment. Runs start, deploys (including Publish with deploy) go through, and steps use the
  server key, so the built-in templates run without saving and binding the key first. The builder,
  templates, Deployments and Secrets pages no longer ask you to bind such a secret.

  The monthly budget in Settings → Workspace is now enforced. Once the runs started this calendar
  month (UTC) have cost the budget, new runs are refused with HTTP 409 from every source (the
  builder, the API, webhooks, schedules, MCP and evaluations) until next month or until the budget is
  raised; runs already going finish. Two new notification events, "80% of the monthly budget is
  spent" and "The monthly budget is used up", reach subscribed channels at most once a month each.
  Settings → Workspace shows this month's spend next to the budget, also available from
  `GET /v1/workspaces/:id/budget` (`flowaid workspace budget`).

  The retention days in Settings → Workspace now apply at the nightly clean-up: runs keep their data
  for the workspace's run days instead of 90 (workflows set to short or long retention keep theirs),
  the audit log keeps entries for the audit days (400 when empty, which the clean-up now also
  applies), and files runs write are deleted after the artifact days even while the run is kept.

### Patch Changes

- feb43fe: Security and reliability hardening (P3-3, P3-4, P3-6, P3-7):

  - With `REDIS_URL`, request rate limits, sign-in throttles and the webhook replay cache are kept in Redis, so they hold across api replicas.
  - Migration 0012 gates the row-level-security bypass on membership in the new `flowaid_rls_bypass` role (granted to `flowaid_app` and the owner, never to the sandbox host's `flowaid_code`). A migrating role without `CREATEROLE` needs the role created first (see `docker/postgres-init/01-roles.sql`).
  - Each mutation's audit row is written inside the transaction that makes the change.
  - `flowaid keys rotate-master` (`pnpm keys`, `node dist/keys.js` in the api image) re-wraps every key-encryption key and re-seals every credential under a new master key, verified and resumable.
  - Timers are due by the database clock, not the worker's.

### Patch Changes

- 859e8fc: Business flows: four complete workflows to start from, each running end to end with only a TypeSafe
  key.

  - **Expense approval** (finance): a policy check, auto-approval under a limit, otherwise a manager
    approval.
  - **Sales lead qualification** (sales): intent, fit and a 0–100 score, routed to sales, nurture,
    support or discard.
  - **IT help desk routing** (IT operations): priority, team and response time, with security
    escalation.
  - **Refund request handling** (customer service): policy, fraud risk and limits, then refund,
    decline or agent review, each with the customer reply.

  They appear first on Templates and on New workflow. Each flow's limits are workflow settings, and a
  new workflow panel (shown when nothing is selected in the builder) renames the workflow, edits its
  description, and edits, adds or removes those settings.

- 702ab83: A first run that works, and says why when it does not. A new starter template, Message triage,
  runs with only a TypeSafe key. Template cards say what each one needs and whether the workspace
  has it, and each "Use template" button names its template.

  In the builder:

  - A step that needs a key gets it in one step (**Add a key for this step**). Before this there was
    no way to declare a secret in the app.
  - Prompt and template fields insert references the compiler accepts (`{{ start.message }}`) instead
    of `input.*`, `nodes.*` and `variables.*`, which never compiled.
  - The Run tab checks required input before sending, lists the problems that block a run with a way
    to reach each one, and shows why the server refused a run (input, keys, connection, permission,
    rate limit), with the request id.
  - The Output tab summarises the run: completed, failed at which step, or waiting for a person, with
    time, cost and the full run.
  - Problems name the node and field.
  - The model picker marks providers that have no key.
  - Publish stays available and its dialog lists what blocks it.
  - Confirm dialogs show a failure instead of failing silently.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 0a0ec14: PageIndex document intelligence: PageIndex knowledge sources index uploaded PDFs into section
  trees with the pinned PageIndex SDK (a private Python service, `./flowaid --pageindex` or the
  compose `pageindex` profile), versioned and deduplicated per file. The new nodes
  `flowaid.pageindex.index`, `.retrieve` (TypeSafe Jev navigates the tree) and `.cite` (every
  citation checked against the page text), document tools for agents, three templates, a source
  page with outline, source viewer and test panel, and `pnpm eval:pageindex` (RFC-0022). Also:
  the web app opens at http://flowaid.localhost:3000 (API on 3001), `./flowaid` starts everything,
  local Ollama works without opening the private network, and upgraded installs receive new
  built-in templates.
